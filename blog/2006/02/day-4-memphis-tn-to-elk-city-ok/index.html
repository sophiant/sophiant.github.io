      <h1>Day 4 - Memphis, TN to Elk City, OK</h1>
      <h6>Distance: 630 miles<br />
States: TN, AR, OK</h6>

<p>As individuals and as a society we are constantly in a state of conflict.  I think nowhere is that more apparent than in Arkansas.  On the state license plate the motto says "The Natural State".  It might be more apropos to say that we all belong to "The Naturally Contradicted State".</p>

<p>I awoke this morning from my revelry in Memphis, TN feeling renewed.  After two nights of somewhat fitful sleep in the van, the clean sheets and hot shower of the downtown Marriott were a welcome respite.  But it was my night out on the town of Memphis that gave me new hope for the south.  It's a vibrant city, with a dynamic music scene and what appeared to be an abundant number of good dining establishments.  I found myself encsonced at the <a href="http://memphis.citysearch.com/profile/11358150">Blue City Cafe</a>.  With its faux corrugated steel tin roof, formica tables, and smoky atmosphere it's got a great ambience and apparently an even better BBQ sauce.  I ended up going with a 16 oz. strip loin seared rare to perfection, steak fries, and of course, Texas toast.  Although the City Search profile recommends the cold Budweiser, my eyes keenly caught a Sam Smith's label in the glass cased refrigerator - after inquiring with the bartender she informed me "<i>yes, we have the Taddy Porter</i>".</p>



<p>Three of those later and I was faced with the vexing question of whether to call it an evening or to carry on late into the night.  I think I chose wisely, slowly walking back to the hotel taking in the brisk night air and lively atmosphere.  There was an energy on the streets - you could tell people were happy to be out and about, a sense of grandiose merriment abound.  But I digress...</p>

<p>The next morning I wrapped up breakfast quickly and wanted to get an early start to the day.  I hadn't been rolling out of bed too early and I wanted to change that up.  I pulled back out onto Highway 40 heading west and immediately crossed over the Mississippi River.</p>

<p>"<i>The Missippi</i>" I thought to myself.  To me the border between east and west.  The dividing line of philosophies.  Eastern uptighted-ness versus Western laid backed-ness.  As I finished crossing  the bridge that spans that mighty river I thought for sure I would immediately feel a sense of calm come wafting over me.  That west coast inner peace I've known to come and love.  Instead I was greeted by a flat plains reminiscent of the Oklahoma landscape I knew I'd soon be driving through</p>

<p>This wasn't the Arkansas I had imagined.  I envisioned ratty old pick-up trucks, swampy forests, bible thumping mentalities.  Don't get me wrong those things are prevalent in Arkansas.  But after winding through those first few miles of bumpy roads and endless plains, it was the beauty of the Ozarks, the crazy town of Altus (more on that in a sec), and the Whole Foods Market near Little Rock that made me realize "<i>this ain't your grandpa's Arkansas</i>".</p>

<p>Arkansas to me is being pulled in opposite directions by each coast.  It was Sunday morning and as I scanned for radio stations (one way I've learned to try and cull the regional spirit) all I could find were biblical broadcasts.  "<i>Repent!  The Lord Jesus shall forgive thy sins</i>".  Then, during the commercial breaks, I would hear "<i>Durex condoms.  Now with special lubricant to help excite her.</i>"  <b>Huh</b>?  What was this juxtaposition?  Later I would be driving past an open plain and see a gentleman's club.  Not a stone's throw away was the local Baptist church.  What was with this place?</p>

<p>In one county the highway was perfect - smooth, newly paved road winding its way through the lower hills that abound in the region.  In the next, a rocky pockmarked journey that caused even Phoebe to shudder her wheels.  BBQ restaurants next to the Whole Foods Market.  Cell phone towers set atop some of the highest peaks in "scenic" State Parks.</p>

<p>And in what was my biggest surprise, my special gem for the today, my divergence, the town of Altus.  Altus is smack dab in the center of one of the largest wine producing regions in the south.  <b><i>Wine in Arkansas???</i></b> Yes, you heard me correctly.</p>

<p>And not bad wine either.  I tasted a Chardonnay from <a href="http://www.chateauauxarc.com">Chateau Aux Arc</a> that was pleasing.  Generally I don't like Chardonnays (they're too "oaky") - but this one was fermented in steel and due to the intense heat of the region in the summertime produced wonderful fruits reminiscent of a Pinot Gris.  And I learned of a Native American grape called Muscadine that has a totally unique taste.  I won't be pairing it with my lamb any time soon, but if I were sprawled out along the river bank on a hot summer's day and put that on my palate I can't say I'd complain.  It reminded me of eating grapes off the vine at my grandfather's home in central New York.</p>

<p>I learned of Altus' history at the Post Familie Vineyards (operating continously since the late 1800's, even during prohibition when they manufactured wine for "communion".  They still do).  Even Altus had it's contradictions however.  The then owner of the Post Familie Vineyards during the prohibition era used to regularly serve her communion wine at her restaurant.  Apparently the feds caught on and she was arrested.  The seemingly strong sense of Catholic traditions and law-abided-ness that is so prevalent in Arkansas apparently has it's limits.</p>

<p>But going back to the sign posts of our lives, and divergence, and all that has happened thus far on this trip - I can say that Arkansas captured perfectly what is going on with each of us, individually, within our communities, and more broadly at a state and national level.  We are <i>all</i> a series of contradictions.  We want public transportation but don't want to pay more taxes.  We want somebody to collect the garbage from our front doorstep but don't want the dump in our back yards.  Arkansas is truly in the center of all this - figuratively, geographically, and I would imagine philosophically as well.  You'd have to Google it of course, but I wouldn't be surprised if Arkansas was more often than not one of the critical "swing states" in the majority of our presidential elections.</p>

<p>Arkansas is a state of extremes.  Plains in the east, Mountains in the West.  Swamps in the South, Forests in the North.  But in a sense we all live in this state (I'm speaking figuratively here of course), whether we're aware of it or not.  We want one thing and say another.  We say thank-you but don't mean it. We are all a series of contradictions.</p>

<p>So thank you Arkansas for opening my eyes.  Not only did you help dispel the prejudices that I had towards your state, but also in making me aware that we are all facing these same contradictions in our own lives, in our own state, in our own minds.</p>
