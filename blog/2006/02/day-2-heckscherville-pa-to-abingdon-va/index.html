      <h1>Day 2 - Heckscherville, PA to Abingdon, VA</h1>
      <h6>Distance: 539 miles<br />
States - PA, MD, WV, VA</h6>
<p>Last night I settled into the coccoon of the Phoenix.  My thoughts were simple and content.  I felt completely secure.  Outside the wind rustled some leaves slightly, and as I drifted off to sleep I heard the tepid patters of the first few raindrops.  Within a few hours I awoke to now strong gusts of wind buffeting and rocking the van.  Rain was coming down in sheets - as I touched the canvas side of the pop top it felt moist to the touch.  But inside I remained warm and dry.  A safe haven from the storm that surrounded me.</p>
<p>Phoebe had performed admiredbly.</p>
<p>And so I awoke a few hours later, feeling refreshed and ready to start a new day.  As I pulled out onto the highway again the once gray skies parted and revealed the beauty of central Pennsylvania. Having reflected on yesterday's journal entry I smiled inwardly, knowing that this was just another sign post that I had chosen the right path.</p>

<p>As I contempleted this trip, I made a promise to myself that each day I would take the opportunity to diverge from the main arteries of traffic and wander out onto one of the more remote veins that connect this country together. I figure it's going to be hit or miss - some times when you stray from the path you come across little gems of beauty, indicators that you are onto something feally good.  Other times you see the ugly underside of our country, a reminder that perhaps not all is well with everyone.  But if you don't wander from that path how are you to ever know anything more than that which you've already experienced?</p>
<p>I expect this trip will have its pitfalls with this approach.  Today, though, was certainly not one of them.</p>
<p>The divergence of the day was to head south along the Susquehannah river, past the capital of Pennsylvania (Harrisburg, silly) and towards the Maryland border.  My destination - Gettysburg.</p>
<p>Now we've all studied the Civil War as children and by now the names of the generals who fought so valiantly those three days at Gettysburg are ingrained in our head.  We know the outcome, perhaps we even remember some of minor skirmishes that took place over those three days.</p>
<p>But it isn't until you stand in the fields of Gettysburg, and look out over the terrain which has remained untouched since that day of battle, that you fully grasp the magnitude of what took place there.  There's an eery quality to Gettysburg.  It's like the ghosts of 3,000 men are echoing their cries - begging to be heard by those that have come after them.  Theirs are stories large and small, and I only wished I had had more time to sit and listen.</p>
<p>What gave me pause and brought me back to the some of the ideas that were swimming in my head yesterday was the idea of choices.  On the first day of battle Lee had had a decisive victory over the Union troops - the battle took place north and west of town and the Union army was forced to retreat through town and up a ridge to the south to escape.  Lee gave chase and captured many soldiers in the process.  But as the day drew to an end he decided to give his exhausted men a rest and let the Union soldiers fight another day.</p>
<p>In what history can now know as a mistake, it allowed the Union soldiers time to entrench themselves and fortify their positions along the ridge as they worked well into the night.</p>
<p>But what if that day Lee had instead insisted on moving forward.  He would have chosen a different path, and all of history would have to be rewritten.  What caused him to give pause?  Was it compassion for his troops?  Or perhaps he listened to his "little voice" - the one that presumably steers us toward our destiny.  Was he pre-ordained to lead those troops there that day only to have them be defeated in the days that followed?  Or was it a choice?</p>
<p>Sadly we'll never know what internal battles Lee fought to come to that decision.  But he made a choice, and took a turn at the sign post.  But that begs the question - is my journey also pre-ordained?  Was I to stop short tonight in Abingdon some 15 miles from the border of Tennessee, or was I to press on to Tennessee?  I chose Abingdon but what if it was never really a choice.  Will I get awoken by the police asking me to "move on please" or did I choose rightly to stop? I won't know I suppose until tomorrow.</p>
<p>I do know that at my stop here I found a supermarket that was open 24 hours, and I had the first real bites of food beyond some bars in a few days.  I'm supremely looking forward to my Weetabix with fresh blueberries in the morning...</p>
<p>And perhaps that's enough.  Perhaps living in the moment, embracing the now and not worrying about the what if is enough for us all.  Maybe Lee didn't have any regrets about stopping his forces that day.  Maybe he knew that ultimately he saved lives by that choice.  So while we all do know what happens (eventually) maybe we're not to know the outcome until well after the choice has been made.  That's the beauty of The Journey.  Celebrating our choices and not regretting the outcomes.</p>
<p>Parting Shot:&nbsp;&nbsp;Point of furthest confederate approach, Cemetary Ridge. They had maybe only 20 yards to go.</p>
