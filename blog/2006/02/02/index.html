  <h6>Distance - 473 miles<br />
States - NH, MA, CT, NY, PA</h6>
<p>When I started driving this morning I didn't know where I'd end up.  As it turns out, I ended up back where it all started.</p>
<p>Last night was spent making the final preparations for my trip across country.  My parents had asked me to look through about four boxes full of childhood memories, stuffed away in the basement collecting mold.  I sifted through old Boy Scout uniforms, trophies, love letters, Red Sox paraphernalia, and an odd assortment of items that had accumulated in my childhood desk.  Pictures from college, grad school applications -- memories found and opportunities lost.</p>
<p>It was a catharctic purge.  One which I haven't felt in some time.  And as I climbed into the van this morning and started driving away from my family home in New Hampshire the idea that I was going back in time, going back to my roots, was at the forefront of my mind.  As I traveled south through Massachusetts and into Connecticut I stopped by an old college friend's family home near Hartford.  I met with her parents for several hours catching up.  I found myself thinking back to collegiate days.</p>
