      <h3><a href="/blog/2006/02/in-bishop-ca/">In Bishop CA</a></h3>
  <p>Made it to Bishop late last night, slept out on the plains outside of town, beautiful quiet.  No noise except the occasional lonesome howl of a coyote.  Today I'm gunning for Bend so I don't have time to write a long post.  Just letting people know...</p>

  <h3><a href="/blog/2006/02/day-6-santa-fe-nm-to-somewhere-near-flagstaff-az/">Day 6: Santa Fe, NM to Somewhere Near Flagstaff, AZ</a></h3>
  <h6>Distance: 508 miles<br />
States: NM, AZ</h6>

<p>I understand now why they call New Mexico the land of enchantment. As mentioned in yesterday's entry, my goal for today was to take the long way through New Mexico winding my way around the back roads of the northwest corner of the state, enjoying the many vistas and views of the area surrounding Los Alamos and the Jemez Mountains.</p>
<p>The day started slowly, taking care of loading up on provisions since I expect that the next few nights I may be camping out away from the highway.  Santa Fe (much to my joy) has a Whole Foods, and I stocked up on some organic micro brews, diestel smoked turkey, southwestern wraps, and an assortment of vegetables and organic soup.  I feel ready for whatever comes my way.</p>

  <h3><a href="/blog/2006/02/day-5-elk-city-ok-to-santa-fe-nm/">Day 5 - Elk City, OK to Santa Fe, NM</a></h3>
  <h6>Distance: 507 miles<br />
States: OK, TX, NM</h6>
<p>The night I spent in Oklahoma was the coldest one thus far.  I had left Memphis yesterday at a reasonably early hour, and knew I had made a lot of distance.  So the goal for today was more utilitarian.  I needed to get to Albuquerque, NM in time to get my oil changed before the dealership closed.  So between the cold (the water in my bottle up in my canvas loft froze) and the impending timeline, I arose at 6 AM and started driving.  It was still dark out.</p>

<p>As I was nearing the Texas border the first lights of dawn were creeping up in the rear view mirror. I've always held a special affection for the sunrise (not that I see many of them) - but there is a spiritual awe that can be invoked by watching the night fade away and the day begin.  Today was especially inspiring because this occurred in that flat plains of Texas.  With nothing but barren landscape surrounding me and only a few cars on the road, the entire eastern horizon was filled with a brilliant light.  The fields toward the west of me glowed red in appreciation.</p>

<p>I felt the pull of home.</p>

  <h3><a href="/blog/2006/02/day-4-memphis-tn-to-elk-city-ok/">Day 4 - Memphis, TN to Elk City, OK</a></h3>
  <h6>Distance: 630 miles<br />
States: TN, AR, OK</h6>

<p>As individuals and as a society we are constantly in a state of conflict.  I think nowhere is that more apparent than in Arkansas.  On the state license plate the motto says "The Natural State".  It might be more apropos to say that we all belong to "The Naturally Contradicted State".</p>

<p>I awoke this morning from my revelry in Memphis, TN feeling renewed.  After two nights of somewhat fitful sleep in the van, the clean sheets and hot shower of the downtown Marriott were a welcome respite.  But it was my night out on the town of Memphis that gave me new hope for the south.  It's a vibrant city, with a dynamic music scene and what appeared to be an abundant number of good dining establishments.  I found myself encsonced at the <a href="http://memphis.citysearch.com/profile/11358150">Blue City Cafe</a>.  With its faux corrugated steel tin roof, formica tables, and smoky atmosphere it's got a great ambience and apparently an even better BBQ sauce.  I ended up going with a 16 oz. strip loin seared rare to perfection, steak fries, and of course, Texas toast.  Although the City Search profile recommends the cold Budweiser, my eyes keenly caught a Sam Smith's label in the glass cased refrigerator - after inquiring with the bartender she informed me "<i>yes, we have the Taddy Porter</i>".</p>

<p>Well, I don't have much time to write.  Gotta get on gettin' on.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.sophiant.com/images/MVI_3349.avi">This movie</a> pretty much sums up my day.</p>
<p>Oh.  And Memphis rocks.  More on that later.  But for now know that all is well. I'm feeling cleansed, rested...</p>

<p>Last night I settled into the coccoon of the Phoenix.  My thoughts were simple and content.  I felt completely secure.  Outside the wind rustled some leaves slightly, and as I drifted off to sleep I heard the tepid patters of the first few raindrops.  Within a few hours I awoke to now strong gusts of wind buffeting and rocking the van.  Rain was coming down in sheets - as I touched the canvas side of the pop top it felt moist to the touch.  But inside I remained warm and dry.  A safe haven from the storm that surrounded me.</p>
<p>Phoebe had performed admiredbly.</p>
<p>And so I awoke a few hours later, feeling refreshed and ready to start a new day.  As I pulled out onto the highway again the once gray skies parted and revealed the beauty of central Pennsylvania. Having reflected on yesterday's journal entry I smiled inwardly, knowing that this was just another sign post that I had chosen the right path.</p>

  <h6>Distance - 473 miles<br />
States - NH, MA, CT, NY, PA</h6>
<p>When I started driving this morning I didn't know where I'd end up.  As it turns out, I ended up back where it all started.</p>
<p>Last night was spent making the final preparations for my trip across country.  My parents had asked me to look through about four boxes full of childhood memories, stuffed away in the basement collecting mold.  I sifted through old Boy Scout uniforms, trophies, love letters, Red Sox paraphernalia, and an odd assortment of items that had accumulated in my childhood desk.  Pictures from college, grad school applications -- memories found and opportunities lost.</p>
<p>It was a catharctic purge.  One which I haven't felt in some time.  And as I climbed into the van this morning and started driving away from my family home in New Hampshire the idea that I was going back in time, going back to my roots, was at the forefront of my mind.  As I traveled south through Massachusetts and into Connecticut I stopped by an old college friend's family home near Hartford.  I met with her parents for several hours catching up.  I found myself thinking back to collegiate days.</p>
