title: A New Look For Sophiant

<p>So I got around to updating the look of Sophiant.  I incorporated a couple of new things.  First and foremost I did away with the &lt;table&gt; layout and got with the times and did the &lt;div&gt; thing.  Threw in some CSS and holy cow!  The HTML code is a lot cleaner.  I'm a big fan of the CSS (no surprises I'm sure from most of the community out there).</p>

I also went ahead and installed typo so I can start writing articles like this.  It was amazingly easy - my props to <a href=`http://www.leetsoft.com/`>Tobias Lutke and whomever else worked on this project</a>.  Not only do I use Typo now, but his <a href=`http://wiki.rubyonrails.com/rails/pages/LoginGenerator`> Login generator</a> is what I used on <a href=`http://www.hh-alpacas.com`>my first Rails website</a>, something I did for my brother-in-law.  I'm not the world's greatest web designer, but I'm increasingly growing fond of the <a href=`www.rubyonrails.com`>Ruby on Rails framework</a> for doing quick and dirty web sites like this.
