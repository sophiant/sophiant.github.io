<p>I haven't updated this blog for a really long time. Too much has happened both personally and professionally to adequately capture what has been, for sure, an incredible ride.</p>
<p>I laughed when I looked back at my posts in November, 2005. I was just beginning to learn Ruby on Rails and still, continue to this day, evolve my understanding of this framework and the Ruby programming language in general. This blog is powered by Typo, and the version of Rails it was frozen at was 0.14. Man, I was pre 1 dot oh!</p>
<p>I don't know how often I'll be able to post articles, I'm hoping to mostly make this a good place to log tips and tricks, experiences from the man cave, and maybe even a little about life at home with twins.&nbsp;</p>
