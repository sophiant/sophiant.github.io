<h6>Distance: 507 miles<br/>
States: OK, TX, NM</h6>
<p>The night I spent in Oklahoma was the coldest one thus far.  I had left Memphis yesterday at a reasonably early hour, and knew I had made a lot of distance.  So the goal for today was more utilitarian.  I needed to get to Albuquerque, NM in time to get my oil changed before the dealership closed.  So between the cold (the water in my bottle up in my canvas loft froze) and the impending timeline, I arose at 6 AM and started driving.  It was still dark out.</p>

<p>As I was nearing the Texas border the first lights of dawn were creeping up in the rear view mirror. I've always held a special affection for the sunrise (not that I see many of them) - but there is a spiritual awe that can be invoked by watching the night fade away and the day begin.  Today was especially inspiring because this occurred in that flat plains of Texas.  With nothing but barren landscape surrounding me and only a few cars on the road, the entire eastern horizon was filled with a brilliant light.  The fields toward the west of me glowed red in appreciation.</p>

<p>I felt the pull of home.</p>

<p>Getting up at 6 AM and driving for five days has, however, sapped my energy.  After crossing into the mountain time zone I found myself about an hour outside of Albuquerque with plenty of time to spare.  I pulled over at a rest area and took an hour nap.  Even after changing the oil I found myself "out of sorts" so I made the executive decision to drive just the extra 50 miles north of Albuquerque to Santa Fe.  For those of you who understand, Redmond is to Albuquerque as Bend is to Santa Fe.  I felt very much at home there.</p>

<p>After an awesome meal at a restaurant that made their own micro-brews, I went down to the hotel lobby where I was staying (yes, I splurged again because I needed the sleep and comfort factor) and tried to do a little coding for a project.  It just wasn't happening.  In trying to get myself back into the "day-to-day" groove of doing work I found my mind resisting.  Since this really is about the journey and not about trip, I knew enough to close my laptop and listen to the live jazz that was playing.</p>

<p>I ended up meeting a guy from NH who graduated schools at the same time I did.  He's a motivational speaker, traveling nationally to high schools and colleges doing leadership seminars.  He was intrigued by my trip and we spent the night chatting away on a number of unrelated topics, philosophy, raising families, you name it.  It was a great connection.</p>

<p>So as I near home and get closer to my love, I am torn.  The road has worn me down and I need to take it slower.  It's also just supremely beautiful here.  Yet at the same time I want so badly to be home and with my wife.  I am writing this at the start of Day 6, and today I plan to at least go check out the Anasazi ruins.  I'll go further from the main "artery" of our national insterstate system than at any other point of this trip.  But something tells me it's going to be worth it.  I won't make as many miles today as I have in other days, which is all the harder knowing that I am closing in on home.  It will be, though, the last digression I think for this trip.</p>

<p>Parting Shot: Sunrise somewhere in the middle of nowhere.</p>
