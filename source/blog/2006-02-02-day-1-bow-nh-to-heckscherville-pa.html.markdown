<p>When I started driving this morning I didn't know where I'd end up.  As it turns out, I ended up back where it all started.</p>
<p>Last night was spent making the final preparations for my trip across country.  My parents had asked me to look through about four boxes full of childhood memories, stuffed away in the basement collecting mold.  I sifted through old Boy Scout uniforms, trophies, love letters, Red Sox paraphernalia, and an odd assortment of items that had accumulated in my childhood desk.  Pictures from college, grad school applications -- memories found and opportunities lost.</p>
<p>It was a catharctic purge.  One which I haven't felt in some time.  And as I climbed into the van this morning and started driving away from my family home in New Hampshire the idea that I was going back in time, going back to my roots, was at the forefront of my mind.  As I traveled south through Massachusetts and into Connecticut I stopped by an old college friend's family home near Hartford.  I met with her parents for several hours catching up.  I found myself thinking back to collegiate days.</p>

<p>Leaving Connecticut and winding my way into New York, I began to recall my middle school years.  I actually drove by the town of Goshen where I spent two years of my life.  It started to strike me that as I was traveling away from Bow I was also traveling backwards in time, re-visiting the home sites of my life in almost reverse order.  It was, as if I was regressing...</p>
<p>...I entered Pennsylvania, crossing the Delaware river.  I recalled earlier memories now, of canoing on that very same river with my parents.  Soon I was in the Poconos, and the earliest memories of all, learning to ski at Camelsback Ski Resort, were coming into view.  I knew that I was drawing nearer to the end of the day.  As I called my wife to help me choose a place to stay for the evening it suddenly dawned on me that I was very close to Pottsville, PA - a scant stone's throw away from the town where I was born - Reading.</p>
<p>Having traveled a mere 473 miles today I knew in my mind's eye that I had also grown younger.  I had in fact, gone back to my birth and I stood awash in the realization that this trip is much more than about just bringing a car back to Oregon.  It's a chance for me to renew.  To honor those memories of childhood that I want to hold on to.  Retain the letters of lost loves and pictures of good friends and great times.  Recall that passion that urged me on to Australia, choosing a path away from the standard post-graduate get a job, get married, have kids kind of life.  Eschew the worldly possessions, the trophies, the random detritus that we as a society tend to put too much emphasis on.  Instead, gather up the memories and experiences, and fondly pack them away neatly in your heart.</p>
<p>On the final drive into Pottsville I traveled down a steep valley road.  Ironically I'd been seeking a wireless connection, driving around town and checking to see if there are any un-secured hot-spots for me to hook my laptop up to.  I thought for sure that I was truly "meant" (in the divinely ordained sort of way) to be here in this town at this moment in time.  That I needed to be here to write these thoughts and get them out as soon as possible.  Of course there were no wireless networks to be found.</p>
<p>In thinking I knew all the answers I learned something even more important.  That there is no clear path.  As soon as I thought I had all the answers I was taught the lesson that there's a lot more to true "knowing".  But the good news is that I have a choice in these matters.  I just need to pay attention to the signposts along the way.</p>
<p>So if this trip is about new paths and new opportunities.  Today was a day then for setting myself up for success.  I traveled back down my old path, recollecting experiences, dusting them off, reminding myself that I've always known who I'm supposed to be.  It was in many senses a rebirth.  And I am renewed, standing at the base of this valley, looking up at the open road and looking forward to the many possibilities that the future may bring.  I won't know always exactly where to go.  But living in the moment and relishing life experiences is today's lesson.</p>
<p>In honor of that rebirth, and given its outrageous red color, Carey and I have decided to christen our car "Phoebe" (based on the mythological bird the Phoenix).</p>

<p>You can call her "Feebs" for short.</p>
<p>Tonight I'm going to finish this stage by driving back out of this valley.  Park myself at the precipice of a new road, pointing home.</p>
