<h6>Distance: 508 miles<br/>
States: NM, AZ</h6>

<p>I understand now why they call New Mexico the land of enchantment. As mentioned in yesterday's entry, my goal for today was to take the long way through New Mexico winding my way around the back roads of the northwest corner of the state, enjoying the many vistas and views of the area surrounding Los Alamos and the Jemez Mountains.</p>
<p>The day started slowly, taking care of loading up on provisions since I expect that the next few nights I may be camping out away from the highway.  Santa Fe (much to my joy) has a Whole Foods, and I stocked up on some organic micro brews, diestel smoked turkey, southwestern wraps, and an assortment of vegetables and organic soup.  I feel ready for whatever comes my way.</p>

<p>Situated about an hours drive north of Santa Fe, the Bandelier National Monument where an Ancestral Pueblo settlement can be found was my main divergence for the day.  I spent a blissful two hours exploring the many ancient ruins and learning about the Pueblo culture.  Simply fascinating.  The highlight for me personally was a hike to the Alcove House.  It used to be called somethng like the Ceremonial Caves but new archaeological evidence suggest that people lived there as well - it wasn't used strictly for ceremonial purposes.  There is a reconstructed kiva at the top of the Alcove House - had to climb about 500' of various wooden ladders set into the cliffside as I made my way up.  Not for the feint of heart.  But sitting alone in the kiva I could feel the spiritual importance of these places.  There were a few people around me, but all were speaking in hushed tones.  Clearly the impact of this place was felt by everyone.</p>
<p>After a run along a mesa that slowly converged to a point overlooking two box canyons (one on either side of me), I finally decided at 4 PM that I should probably start making my way west again ;-).  The enchantment of the area was clearly not lost on me.  I did, however, continue along state route 4 instead of back-tracking through Los Alamos and back down 25.  This scenic road meanders its way through the Jemez mountains, and on another trip I'll plan on doing some backpacking in the area.  It's gorgoeus.  The highlight of the drive was the Valle Grande, a huge caldera that's a dry lake bed but filled with dry yellow grasses.  The contrast between the coniferous trees surrounding the bowl and the grasses was fascinating in the waning light of the day.  I finally made my way out of the mountains, and sadly, back into the traffic of Albuquerque during rush hour.</p>
<p>Now happily fed (I had to stop once during this trip for a Cracker Barrel experience (they are <i>everywhere</i> now) I'm ready to knock out some miles late into the evening.</p>
<p><b>Prologue:</b> As it turns out - I knocked off quite a few miles, almost making it to Flagstaff, Arizona.  A friend had told me about a run just on the outskirts of town and I had thought that maybe I would park at the trailhead and start my run first thing in the morning.  As 11:00 PM approached I realized I was getting tired and that perhaps Flagstaff was too aggressive.  I pulled over in Winslow, Arizona (yes, the Eagles song) but the place didn't settle well with me.  Couldn't find a place for Phoebe that felt secure enough yet away from the highway.  After about 45 mins. of trying I shrugged it off and pulled back onto the highway heading west, thinking that perhaps I would have to make it to Flagstaff after all.  I quickly realized that this wasn't the smartest idea, so I told myself that at whatever the next exit was I was going to pull off.  There was a sign for state route 99 north.  I took it, and followed through barren fields and private farms for the next 20 miles or so.  It was getting really late now.  I entered a Navajo village called Leupp and the idea of spending a day in a trible jail cell didn't sound appealing.  A saw a small sign for Flagstaff and headed out on a county road that pointed towards the San Fracisco mountains north of Flagstaff</p>
<p>Now signposts and good omens seem to be a theme throughout this trip.  I really enjoyed my stay in Santa Fe (the locals refer to it as 'SF') and in point of fact the night I stayed in SF was on San Francisco street.  Room 224.  Now here I was, in the midst of night, driving along on a remote county road, heading towards the SF mountains.  Hmm....</p>
<p>... the drive was gorgeous.  The surrounding high desert plains were lit by the waxing moon and I could make out the eerie shapes of the various coniferous trees that dotted the surrounding the hillsides.  Although I was exhausted, I could tell that I was in a beautiful, remote part of Arizona that I would guess very few tourists get a chance to see.  There were no lights of any kind, no power lines, no sign of human existence really other than the road that stretched out before me...</p>
<p>... I passed a sign that read "Welcome To Coconino National Forest".  "<i>A national forest out here?  There's not one on the map I have...</i>", I thought to myself.  But sure enough - nature reached out her gentle hand and guided me once again.  Believe it or not, I actually passed forest service road 224 - the exact same room number I had the night previously in Santa Fe - and I knew that this actual, physical sign post, was pointing me to head off the road.</p>
<p>And so I did.</p>
<p>And I slept beautifully.</p>
